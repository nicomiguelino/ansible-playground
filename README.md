# Ansible Playground

This repository serves as a platform for getting started and
experimenting with Ansible.


## Developer Tools

To install the developer tools on your Raspberry Pi, run the
following:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicomiguelino/ansible-playground/main/install-devtools.sh)
```

We'll soon introduce Ansible playbooks for easier automation.
